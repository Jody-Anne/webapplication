WebApplication
WebApplication is a React app with an Express backend that allows users to search for songs and books and add them to their favorites.

Installation
To run this app on your local machine, you will need to have npm and Node.js installed.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/WebApplication.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd WebApplication
Install the dependencies: npm install
Usage
To start the app, run npm start in the project directory. This will start both the frontend and backend servers.

Search
To search for a song or book, enter a query in the search bar on the homepage and click the search button. The app will display a list of results, which can be expanded by clicking the "show more" button.

Favorites
To add a song or book to your favorites, click the heart icon next to the item in the search results. The item will then appear in the favorites tab.

Security
The backend of the app is secured using the Helmet middleware. This helps to protect against common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

Project Structure
The app is structured with a backend folder and a ui folder for the frontend.

The backend folder contains the server.js file, which sets up the Express server and defines the routes for the API.

The ui folder contains the React components and styles for the frontend. The App.js file is the top-level component that renders the other components and handles state management.
